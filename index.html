		<p class="explanation">I chose this question because I wanted to see if all of the districts had a similar amount of crimes reported.  My initial hypothesis was that there would be at least one district that would be outstandingly greater than all the others in the amount of crimes reported.  I decided to use a donut chart because it allows viewers to see how each district is doing in crime rates in relation to all the other districts in New Orleans.  Using a donut chart also allows each district to have itâ€™s own distinct color.  This would not have been as effective in a bar graph.  This visualization gave me a lot of insight to the database, since it disproved my initial hypothesis.  It also has revealed to me that there is an almost even amount of crimes reported in all the districts of New Orleans.  This made me want to dig deeper to see if the evenness would hold if I singled out crimes for assault across all districts.  </p>
