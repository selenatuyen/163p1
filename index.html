		<p class="explanation">I chose this question because I wanted to see if all of the districts had a similar amount of crimes reported.  My initial hypothesis was that there would be at least one district that would be outstandingly greater than all the others in the amount of crimes reported.  I decided to use a donut chart because it allows viewers to see how each district is doing in crime rates in relation to all the other districts in New Orleans.  Using a donut chart also allows each district to have itâ€™s own distinct color.  This would not have been as effective in a bar graph.  This visualization gave me a lot of insight to the database, since it disproved my initial hypothesis.  It also has revealed to me that there is an almost even amount of crimes reported in all the districts of New Orleans.  This made me want to dig deeper to see if the evenness would hold if I singled out crimes for assault across all districts.  </p>

			<h3>Which district in New Orleans has the most assaults?</h3>

			<p class="caption">Chart above shows the amount of assualts reported throughout all districts in New Orleans.</p>
			<p class="explanation">I chose this question because I wanted to see if the amount of assaults reported in all districts would hold the same pattern as overall crimes reported.  I decided to use a bar chart this time since in the previous visualization I found the percentages of crimes reported to be around the same.  Due to this, I think a bar graph would make any differences in amounts of assaults reported more apparent to the viewer.  This visualization revealed that although all the districts seem to have the same amount of overall crimes reported, there is an apparent difference in looking at only reports of assault throughout each district.  I found that district 7 had almost double the amount of reports of assault compared to the other districts.  It is interesting since district 7 also had the most overall crimes reported by a slim margin, but the margin grows significantly when singling out assaults.  To add another layer to this, I wanted to see the breakdown of each month within the district with the most amount of crime.  </p>
